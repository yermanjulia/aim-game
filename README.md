# Aim Training Game

This is an interactive game developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim of the game is to click on the moving circle as many times as possible within a set time.

## Overview

The game consists of three stages:
1. Welcome screen
2. Timer selection
3. Game screen

Initially, the game welcomes the user and provides a "Start" button. Once clicked, the user is directed to a timer selection screen. The user can select a game duration (10, 20, or 30 seconds). When a time is chosen, the game screen appears with a countdown timer. The goal is to click on the circle as often as possible within the selected time.

## Files

The project includes three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.

2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that handles the styling of the game screens, buttons, and the moving circle.

3. `app.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game's functionality. This includes moving the circle to random locations, keeping the score, and handling the countdown timer.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.
2. Click "Start" on the welcome screen.
3. Select the desired game duration on the next screen.
4. On the game screen, click on the circle as many times as possible before the time runs out.
